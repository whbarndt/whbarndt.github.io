# Past Projects

## Computer Science Degree Projects
Computer Science Degree Related Projects as a reference for experience

### OpenGL Particle System Simulation (Fall 2020)
Created a Modern OpenGL particle system in C++ to learn more about the computer graphics pipeline. [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/ParticleSystemDemoOpenGL)

### Tic-Tac-Toe GOFAI GUI Game (Spring 2021)
Created a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ using the Raylib library. You play against an A.I. that uses either a Minimax or a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. You can also watch two A.I.'s play one another. [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/TicTacToeRaylib)

### Web-Based Blackjack game (Spring 2021)
Created a simple static website with simple graphics to play Blackjack with made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/web-based-blackjack)

### Interfaced with a Roomba Vacuum Cleaner (Fall 2022)
Learned how to interface with a Roomba and programmed it to "Scream" whenever it ran into the wall with its bumper sensor. [See Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@whbarndt/silence-of-the-roombas-f13be61aa797) 

### Parallelized OpenGL Particle System Simulation (Fall 2021)
Took the original OpenGL particle system project and parallelized the particle physics using CUDA and OpenMP. [See Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/ParticleSystemDemoOpenGL/tree/parallelization-cuda-openmp)

### Created a simple Unix Shell (Spring 2022)
Created a simple custom Unix shell with basic Bash command compatibilities and a few custom commands [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/hesh)

### Matplotlib wrapper library: Wrapplotlib (Fall 2022)
Started a wrapper library for Python's Matplotlib library to simplify usability with it and be able to use default parameters. [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/wrapplotlib)

## *Capstone Project*: Deep Learning for Forest Fire Detection (Spring 2023)
Created a web app that allows for upload and test of images on if there is a fire in an image and where the fire is. Which used a variety of Deep Learning Architectures and the TensorFlow library. [See GitHub]

## Physics Degree Projects

### 1D Alfen Wave Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation (Spring 2021)
Created a 1-D Plasma Alfen wave simulation in Python to gain a better understanding of the physical and mathematical principles that govern Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems and well as understanding how to work with programming partial differential equations in systems. [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/MHD-Alfven-Wave-1D-Sim)

### Jupyter Notebook with Legendre Function Generation (Fall 2022)
Created a Jupyter Notebook in Python to generate Legendre Polynomials using SymPy [See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/physics-classes-notebooks)

## *Capstone Project*: Investigating the Performance of a Semi-Professional Magnetometer for Space Weather Research: 13 Years of Measurements from a Backyard in Anchorage (Sprint 2023)
