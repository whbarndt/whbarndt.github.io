## Computer Science Degree Projects
Computer Science Degree Related Projects as a reference for experience:

### OpenGL Particle System Simulation (Fall 2020)
Created a Modern OpenGL particle system in C++ to learn more about the computer graphics pipeline. 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/ParticleSystemDemoOpenGL)

### Tic-Tac-Toe GOFAI GUI Game (Spring 2021)
Created a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ using the Raylib library. You play against an A.I. that uses either a Minimax or a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. You can also watch two A.I.'s play one another. 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/TicTacToeRaylib)

### Web-Based Blackjack game (Spring 2021)
Created a simple static website with simple graphics to play Blackjack with made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/web-based-blackjack)

### Parallelized OpenGL Particle System Simulation (Fall 2021)
Took the original OpenGL particle system project and parallelized the particle physics using CUDA and OpenMP. 

[See Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/ParticleSystemDemoOpenGL/tree/parallelization-cuda-openmp)

### MacGyvered a Roomba to Scream when it Ran Into Walls... (Fall 2021)
Learned how to interface with a Roomba and programmed it to "Scream" whenever it ran into the wall with its bumper sensor. Really funny, read my medium article about it...

[See Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@whbarndt/silence-of-the-roombas-f13be61aa797) 

### Created a simple Unix Shell (Spring 2022)
Created a simple custom Unix shell with basic Bash command compatibilities and a few custom commands 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/hesh)

### Matplotlib wrapper library: Wrapplotlib (Fall 2022)
Started a wrapper library for Python's Matplotlib library to simplify usability with it and be able to use default parameters. 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/wrapplotlib)

### ***Capstone Project***: Deep Learning for Forest Fire Detection (Spring 2023)
Created a web app that allows for upload and test of images on if there is a fire in an image and where the fire is. Which used a variety of Deep Learning Architectures and the TensorFlow library.

[See GitHub](https://github.com/akdasUAF/ForestFireDetection)

## Physics Degree Projects

### Analysis of Simulated IceTop Detector Data to Study the Behavior of Snow Attenuation on Cosmic Ray Signals in the Detector (Fall 2018 - Spring 2019)
{In-Progress} -

### Plasma Physics Lab, University of Alaska Anchorage
#### Studying the Properties of the Corona Discharge Phenomena under an Magnetic Field (Fall 2019 - Fall 2021)
As a part of the UAA Plasma lab, I helped research the properties of the corona discharge under a magnetic field. I created simulations and models using the COMSOL software so that it would be possible to compare to our in-person corona discharge setup. I was awarded the 2020 Alaska Space Grant Apprenticeship (ASGA) to work on this project.

#### Other Smaller Projects (Fall 2021 - Spring 2022)
In the latter part of my time at the Plasma Physics Lab, I worked further on COMSOL models, however, started pursuing other model creations in VSim to expand research on the plasma discharge conditions and started assisting in the Multi-Pole Plasma Trap project in the lab.

### 1D Alfen Wave Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation (Spring 2021)
Created a 1-D Plasma Alfen wave simulation in Python to gain a better understanding of the physical and mathematical principles that govern Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems and well as understanding how to work with programming partial differential equations in systems. 

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/MHD-Alfven-Wave-1D-Sim)

### Jupyter Notebook of Symbolic Legendre Function (and other Differential Equation Solutions) Generation (Fall 2022)
Created a Jupyter Notebook in Python to easily generate Legendre Polynomials and other types of differential equations solutions (Bessel, Lagerre, and more) using SymPy.

[See GitHub](https://github.com/whbarndt/physics-classes-notebooks)

### ***Capstone Project***: Investigating the Performance of a Semi-Professional Magnetometer for Space Weather Research: 13 Years of Measurements from a Backyard in Anchorage (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)
{In-Progress} - 
See my paper published in the Journal of Society of Ametuer Radio Astronomers Sept-Oct Issue and my Powerpoint presentation for my Physics Capstone project presentation below:

## Professional Projects {In-Progress}

### Historical Remotely Sensed Snowpack Assessment of the Chena Basin in Alaska During the Snow Depletion Period (Summer 2021 - Fall 2022)
{In-Progress} -
See my poster I presented at AMS 2023:

### Snow Hydrology - The Study of the Snowâ€™s Role in the Water Cycle (July 2023 - Present)
{In-Progress} - 
I work as an Associate Mentor with the [Department of Energy, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program](https://www.arm.gov), helping process and analyze data from the North Slope of Alaska research facility. You can find the instruments I help mentor [here](https://www.arm.gov/connect-with-arm/organization/instrument-mentors/list).

Current goals of this project is to understand the operational capacities of each instrument and analyze their use scientifically. My project advisors and I would like to also create a schema, combining the information of each instrument to be able to identify different types of snow events that occur in the North Slope of Alaska environment. Which, will be used to help study what a snow season looks like up in the North. 

## Personal Projects {In-Progress}

### How Do Americans Use Their Time? A Systematic Investigation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) (Aug 2023 - Present)
{In-Progress} - 
See my GitHub on current project progress:
